# Ravolo 🌾🚜

**Ravolo** is an addictive, high-frequency MMO farming simulator built for mobile platforms using Expo and React Native. The game emphasizes real-time micro-economies, strict time-management mechanics (FOMO), and dynamic player interactions.

## Key Features

- **High-Frequency Performance:** Driven by heavily optimized WebSockets and Protobuf for blazing-fast payload transmission, minimal battery drain, and instant UI updates.
- **FOMO Mechanics:** Crops wither if ignored. Animals get sad, then sick. A fleeting Black Market Trader forces players to log in regularly.
- **Social & Economic Warfare:** Join Syndicates (Cartels) to manipulate market commodities, send gifts via P2P transfers, or coordinate protests against mega-rich farmers to trigger punishing tax decrees.
- **Global Server Systems:** Watch the dynamic live leaderboard, contribute to massive global server bounties, and experience a progressive wealth tax that balances the economy.
- **Offline Capabilities:** Local-first architecture allows you to manage crops and animals on the go, synchronizing seamlessly with the server when reconnected.
